# Buidling a Decentralized Sports Social Network

This is an initiative to create a decentralized social network for athletes. We are searching for people with any background to define with me how the project could like and how to bring it to life. 

# Why?

Currently strava has almost a monopoly as a sports social network, and over the years has become more and more restrictives on the usage users can do with their data. We believe that users should have the right to control where their data is stored, how it is used, and with who it is shared.
